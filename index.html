        <h2>General information</h2>
        <p><b><i>The Great Gatsby</i></b> is a <b>1925</b> novel by American writer <b><i>F. Scott Fitzgerald</i></b>. Set in the Jazz Age on Long Island, near New York City, the novel depicts first-person narrator Nick Carraway's interactions with mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and Gatsby's obsession to reunite with his former lover, Daisy Buchanan.</p>
        <p>After its publication by Scribner's in <b>April 1925</b>, The Great Gatsby received generally favorable reviews, though some literary critics believed it did not equal Fitzgerald's previous efforts. Compared to his earlier novels, such as <b>This Side of Paradise</b> and T<b>he Beautiful and Damned</b>, Gatsby was a commercial disappointment. It sold fewer than 20,000 copies by October, and Fitzgerald's hopes of a monetary windfall from the novel were unrealized. When the author died in <b>1940</b>, he believed himself to be a failure and his work forgotten.</p>
        <p>Gatsby continues to attract popular and scholarly attention. Contemporary scholars emphasize the novel's treatment of social class, inherited versus self-made wealth, gender, race, and environmentalism, and its cynical attitude towards the <b>American Dream</b>. One persistent item of criticism is an allegation of antisemitic stereotyping. <b><i>The Great Gatsby</i></b> is widely considered to be a literary masterwork and a contender for the title of the Great American Novel.</p>
